# 1ï»¿. The principle

Let's talk about how a database works. It store some kind of value and you can read, create, update or delete a record inside if you have permission. When you read, it doesn't affect the value inside but if you want to create, update or delete a record, you need to do a transaction to change it. How Blockchain stores data in the same way, but more specifically as a record called state and transactions are stored as a log in the Block. Like this:

The difference is that Blockchain's database is secured by many maintainers called Node. So it's much harder than a traditional database if you want to hide something that makes your value stored differently from what it really is
