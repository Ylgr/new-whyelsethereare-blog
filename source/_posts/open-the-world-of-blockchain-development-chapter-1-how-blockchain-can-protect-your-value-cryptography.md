Being a store of worth thing meaning it must be strong to protect itself. This chapter we will get close to cryptography. The way they deal with sensitive information, and still keeping it public that everyone can verify it. Let's go!

# How you can keep the secret

On Blockchain or any other field that uses Cryptography or can be called Digital Signatures, there are two types of keys that go together, that is Private key and Public key.

Before Cryptography, we usually using fingerprint or written signature because we know only that person can make it (although it could be fake). In digital world, it still the same. If a message have a signature that you know it's Public key. You know the person created that without knowing the value of their Private key.

More than it, the scenario addition that you can send a secret message to owner of Public key by using that key to encrypt your message, then only it's owner can decrypt and read that message.

It like Alice using Bob locker to lock her message on the box then send it to Bob. Then Box using his key to unlock that box and read message inside, no one else can read that message even Alice but why do she need it?
