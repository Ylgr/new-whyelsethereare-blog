# Byzantine fault tolerance

This is a traditional topic to check if a server can be inconsistently. In its simplest form, a number of generals are attacking a fortress and they must decide as a group whether to attack or retreat. Some generals may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat. The important thing is that all generals agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become aÂ [Rout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rout "Rout"), and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.

In computer science field, we will make an election by using [ECC](https://en.whyelsetheyare.tk/2022/10/30/open-the-world-of-blockchain-development-chapter-1-how-blockchain-can-protect-your-value-cryptography/) to make unique signed vote of each general that can be easy verify (hard to fake).

The strategy is: First, we need to choose a decision is attack or retreat. For example we would choosing attack, then make a election with others generals. If number of vote that have same result as attack more than 2/3+1 vote, then attack is a final decision. Otherwise the election is stuck there so they will do nothing and continue the siege.
