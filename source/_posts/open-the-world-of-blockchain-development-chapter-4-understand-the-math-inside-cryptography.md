Decentralized means having many of the same things: Same in data, same in program, ... How about input from the client, which can be accidentally sent to the server multiple times? This problem even many centralized systems need to find a way to solve. It may be more difficult in decentralize environment, right? Yep, but it has some solution for this problem in decentralize way that we will find out in this topic.

# First solution UTXO

Iï»¿n the first generation of Blockchain, beside of Bitcoin, we have many other Blockchains that follow by this solution rule: UTXO (stand for Unspent transaction output).

The information that UTXO have is: input, output, timestamp, hash.

Typically, that type of Blockchain don't save your balance to query, so you need to get sum number of your UTXO in your account to get the number.



# The nonce

# The speed aka the timestamp
