When developing smart contracts, it's important to be aware of common errors that can arise and potentially cause issues in the future. Some of these errors may seem minor or inconsequential at first but can have serious consequences over time if left unchecked.

# Reentrancy

Just image, you are meeting a seashell collector. He offers you a lamp, a pen and a notebook for your seashell at price one seashell or each. You only have one seashell, so you have a strategy to has both of them that is: You show seashell to have seller give you lamp, them picking another two lefts. After has all three items, you hand over your seashell to him then run aways carrying all three items. Of course, you cannot do that in real life but not at all, still can do it in some situations. Blockchain reentrancy is work like that.

Here is the way it happens in Smart contract by vulnerability logic.
