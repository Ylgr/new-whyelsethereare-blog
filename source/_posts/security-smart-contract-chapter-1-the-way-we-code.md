In the past, we have warned about the perils of the dark forest and the risk of losing one's hard-earned money in the unpredictable world of crypto. However, it's not just your finances that are in danger - navigating the realm of crypto development can be equally treacherous. In this series, we will explore ways to safely traverse this mystical terrain and avoid the dangers that lurk in the shadows.

# Do it in the code

## Prevent the exception

![](https://storage.potatomedia.co/articles/potato_1a628609-4e8d-461f-9451-91ad9d899023_d720abe8065c56ddd4b96c552997a881ce9d79b1.png)
One of the most fundamental ways to prevent exceptions in your code is to use error handling, which can be accomplished through the use of the require(), assert(), and revert() functions. While all three of these functions can be used in various situations, there are some best practices that should be followed to ensure that your code is robust and error-free.

Firstly, the require() function is best used for checking input data, such as function parameters. For example, you could use it to check if a user has enough balance to complete a transaction, like so:

```
require(balanceOf(this) > transferAmount, "You don't have enough balance");
```

Secondly, the assert() function should only be used to verify the final result and should be reserved for handling internal errors. For example, you could use it to check if the balance of an address has been updated correctly after a transaction:

```
assert(address(this).balance == balanceBeforeTransfer - msg.value / 2);
```

Lastly, the revert() function should be used to throw exceptions and prevent execution of certain logic. For instance, you could use it to prevent a certain action from being taken if a system is not active:

```
if(isActive) {
 doSomething();
} else {
 revert("System has not been active")
```
By using these functions properly, you can ensure that your code is resilient to errors and operates smoothly under various circumstances.
