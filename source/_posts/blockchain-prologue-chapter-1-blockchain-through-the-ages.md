## 1.1. Bankrupt

In years 2007-2008, property prices have increased to the all time high, then crashing down suddenly. It make some opportunity to buy a house may be cheaper than to rent one. In that period of time, many banks and people lost their money when investing property. And that's not a small number, bankrupt happen first at there, then business lost their money from that too and many of that not enough money left to keep the business running so they has to be bankrupt.

Because all of those reason, the government has issued a policy called quantitative easing. It mean many money suddenly printed and drop into economic, firstly it make banks and businesses have more money to operate and people has money from work to spend it again. But after all, it make total money greater than before but other asset still equal. So the money lost it price and inflation occurs.

## 1.2. Fiat money problem

That policy mean now central banks or SEC can print any amount of money without have enough gold to protect it price. From that time to now, a huge amount of money was print make US dollar price down. Over time with one dollar, the amount of redemption value will decrease and you will buy less items because of that. Fortunately, thanks to the development of science and technology, life is getting easier and easier with a small amount of money.
