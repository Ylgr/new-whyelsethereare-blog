BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPER

I have experience working with Solidity (EVM), Anchor (Solana) and Substrate (Polkadot). have researched, edited and tested Solidity projects: Balancer, Opensea, Wyvern Protocol, Lens Protocol and ENS. Below is a list of Blockchain skills that I have gained throughout my career. I used it to plan my blog posts:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Blockchain is a very fast growing field but at the same time users can understand this technology and use it for real life use cases that cannot grow as fast as Blockchain development. Maybe at some point, Blockchain will have an innovation impactful enough to make people feel like they can't live without it.
I really wanted to be a part of that innovation and wanted to be a Blockchain expert at that time.
