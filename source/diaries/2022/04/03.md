Yeah yeah, first night at Phu Quoc islands. Today is very tired day, after get out of the plane, It takes plenty of time for wait other member of team. And I don't have time to have lunch, but dinner come early so it is okay.

After the dinner, we go to the Grandworld (part of Vinpearl). It is okay with Paris-style building.

At first, I see it very glorious, but after 1 hours spend for just walking, I'm exhausted and see it not very interesting. Alright, alright. If I have a girlfriend, I will come back here later to more enjoy it. At here it make me feeling lonely.

I think I can call it a day and finish it now. So, good night.
