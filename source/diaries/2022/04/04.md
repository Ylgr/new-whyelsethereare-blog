3:33 PM, on the plane during flying time.

Today I seat at a special place. It is on the seat number 10E, next to staff of the airplane and my current boss.

Yesterday, I need to write down something but too tired to write, so I need to write it right now but not sure if it is good enough like the feeling a had yesterday.

I just had a bottle of water. It named Aquafina like usual.

Yesterday, I have many mistakes. First I think if I can rest somewhere and write something, but I am not going to the caf√© so nowhere for writing habit. And after going with team for a short time, I spilt when have a chance to going to Roster coaster. Still, not regret it but it makes me some feeling. That is feeling of lonely.

If I am alone, It is not feeling hurt much. When it comes to a group, and I can't have a communication with anyone, it is really hurt. I don't know. I need to find out a way to escape that, so I split with the team and go alone. Feeling of frustrating (don't know if I write down it correctly).

The kid near me now is very annoying. I think when I come back to Hanoi, I need to tell this with my family. Hope have some contact with some kind of girl has steel elements to teach me how to work with the feeling. After all I am just too technical person so, yeah bad at feeling.

3:47 PM, talk about yesterday again, they
