1:11 AM.
So I was positive with Covid-19. It was awful. I may think some point I can't breathe and will die during sleep. Luckily until now I still okay and the disease is weaker by time, and maybe my lung too.

Today I need to finish my new plan for study English. Yeah, I used to be easy with Elsa but now I need more challenge.

So what category should I try?

I need to list up some way.

1. Practice IELTS exam.

2. Write some topic for my Blog and check it more carefully (It will be good for my profile too).

3. Research more about how to learn at QVO (ok, I will choose this when wake up).

4. Listen some conversation and write down exactly what It is (Kurzge)
