# Answer:

## Tell me about yourself:

I am a Developer with 4 years of experience, include 3 years working with Blockchain technology. I am aiming to become Blockchain expert, so now I want to make a step to try opportunity outside of Vietnam.Currently, my English communication ability is not really good, so it may take time to answer your questions, hope you don't mind it.

## Tell me your experience in 3 years working in Blockchain field.

First, I learn about Blockchain just to learn about Crypto to invest. After knowing that, I was very excited about it and wanted to join that Technology. That is when I was final years at university and had a job as a Backend developer, I choose my graduate project is Blockchain and that time I was using Hyperledger Fabric to build one. It is not a success project, but it helps me learn a lot. 

After graduation, I join in a Crypto company and take part in build Wallet project, our team build one based on Trust wallet core, and I had main responsibility to research about Cryptography and integrate to that project. Then take part in to other project integrate with Blockchain like, game, stake, ...

Then I join in other outsource company and start building Smart contracts on Ethereum and Binance smart chain, then they promote me to become team lead handle a Project building a Chain. Firstly, they plan to build a new one based on Tendermint but then had some problem to integrate EVM to it. I research and suggest Substrate, then project switch to that technology.

After that, I join my current company for build a Blockchain social network but at that time they just want to use Blockchain in their product and still not knowing what to do with Blockchain technology. Become team lead of Blockchain team, learning more about Blockchain technology and helping my boss know what they want to build on the Blockchain. At that time, I had to research many technology like: Solana, Near, Avalanche, Cardano, ... I am really impressed by Solana and want to use that on product but be rejected because they think it still not stable Blockchain and had to looking for human resources.

## Why do you want to join my company

Most important is for better salary, and an environment to improve my English skill. 

The other reason is: 
- I believe on the future of Solana, so I want to learn more about it through work.
- I like play game with fantasy theme so maybe take part in develop one sound interesting.
