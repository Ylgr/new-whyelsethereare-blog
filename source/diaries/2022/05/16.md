12:33 AM Finally, the day that I commit I will apply to some jobs need English communication in Singapore (bravo).

So I need to prepare interview question to answer them.

Let's pick the book: Cracking the code interview to see some suggest of that.

Hmm, just some thinking about the employer. I think I am too lazy at this point so, direct to te question now.

# Common question

### Tell me a little about yourself.

I am a geek who was inspired by Blockchain technology. Currently, being a Blockchain tech lead of a Project that sold eleven millions BUSD on BSC. I have 4 years in Development include 3 years of experience in Blockchain development and want to expert on this field. 

### Why are you leaving your current job?

There are two reason for leaving:
- mostly is about salary, it's may be a good salary in Vietnam, but compare to other country, it still low.
- other reason is company need to focus human resource on main product currently developmen. It is social network application, so my team need to split up and join them. It still help me have much experience but it still not Blockchain, so It make me feeling uncomfortable sometime.

### What are your salary expectations?

Maybe 4000$ for remote or 7000$ for onsite. I don't have much experient about base salary in Singapore.
