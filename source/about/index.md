Tu Nguyen (just call me Yu) - a Blockchain engineer and like to be a storyteller. 

Believing in the "Singularity" should be both excited about a future mixed with fantasy and future science and afraid of one day being abandoned by the world, so I always try to find potential development directions for myself.

Likes to talk about the world as a wonderland where life isn't as it should be but you have the right to live it the way you dream.

Focusing on Blockchain expertise, ready to listen and share Blockchain solutions. For a great revolution of this field to the world.
